#### Description

Take ± 6 hours to add an `MongoDB` database to your project.

All of your data is going to be stored in a database called MongoDB. You have two options: go with a database as a service [DBaaS](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) or use [MongoDB locally](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/). You can use a [MongoDB GUI](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) to see and manipulate your data.

* Store sensitive information such as your database URI, password and username in `.env`

**Research**  
Include a diagram in your readme that explains how the database works
(**hint**: [Google Drawings][drawings]).

**Build**

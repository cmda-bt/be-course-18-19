## Oral Test - Individual
This is an oral test where you present your final project. You will show you can create a quality project in which you apply the subject matter of this course and that you understand it. You will answer questions in such a way as to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our goals.

### Preperation
* Bring your own computer and a charger.
* Have the latest version of your code ready in your editor.
* Open up your docs inside of your GitHub repository.
* Have a live version up and running.

> Make sure your repository stays online after the oral test is finished, we might want to check the code handed in on GitHub after the test. We also want to download and archive your project when it’s done.

### Evaluation

| Prerequisites                                                              |                          
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source code is available on GitHub                                         |
| Live version of the application is deployed                                |
| Seperation of concerns (HTML, CSS & JS)                                    |
| Cites the sources used; either in code comments or APA style in readme     |
| Code validates and semantic HTML is used                                   |

💁  We don’t like plagiarism and report it to our assessment committee
([examencommissie](https://moodle.cmd.hva.nl/mod/page/view.php?id=1738) in Dutch). See ¶ 6.1.2 of Teaching and Examination

> a. using or copying someone else’s texts, data or ideas without a full and
> correct acknowledgement of sources;
> b. presenting the structure or central ideas developed by someone else as

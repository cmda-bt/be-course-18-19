# Week 6

> Your documentation is complete when someone can use your module without ever
> having to look at its code.
> This is very important.
> This makes it possible for you to separate your module’s documented interface
> from its internal implementation (guts).
> This is good because it means that you are free to change the module’s
> internals as long as the interface remains the same.
>
> Remember: the documentation, not the code, defines what a module does.

## Lab

 You can continue working on your prototype for the final assesment.

#### Preparation

Make sure you come to the lab prepared in advance: 

* Know which questions you want to ask.
* If you have a bug, investigate and try to make a detailed explanation of your problem.
* Ask other students if they encountered the same problem.

#### Demo

We'll do a live demo or recap a specific topic from previous lessons.

#### Review

During these classes we'll also be reviewing each others code. Make sure you made progress so you have something to get feedback on. 

#### Tips

*   Stuck?  See the [Bugs][] section of the   course readme to find a list of
    troubleshooting tips
